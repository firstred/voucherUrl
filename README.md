voucherUrl
==========

Voucher Url is s simple Prestashop Module that allows passing voucher codes through the URL
ItÂ´s as easy to use as adding the parameter 'voucher' anywhere in the URL, in any prestashop page.
The code will have to be created, of course, previously.

Once added it will create a temporary variable in the global cookie with the name of the voucher and will add it to the cart once the cart meets the voucher requeriments. Once this happens the temp variable is removed.

Voucher will be added only if cart products total are higher than minimum purhase and higher than minimun voucher.

example URL: 

http:://myshop.com/index.php?voucher=MYVOUCHER

http:://myshop.com/es/ipods?voucher=MYVOUCHER

Any fix you find or any improvement will be wellcomed and added.
